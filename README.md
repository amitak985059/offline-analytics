# Offline-First User Journey & Analytics Portal

## Overview

This project is an **Offline-First User Journey & Analytics Portal** built using the **MERN stack** with **Next.js** for the frontend. It allows tracking and recording of user activities on a website **regardless of internet connectivity**. The core goal is to ensure that **user activity data is not lost even when offline**, and is reliably synchronized to the server once the internet connection is restored.

## Problem Statement

Modern analytics platforms generally assume a stable internet connection. However, in real-world scenariosâ€”especially in developing regions or during brief outagesâ€”users can go offline temporarily. This leads to gaps in tracking user behavior, which is critical for user experience optimization and business insights.

This project solves the problem of **reliable user activity tracking** in both **online and offline** modes:

- When **online**, user events are captured and sent directly to the backend.
- When **offline**, events are stored locally (e.g., in `mongoDb` or `localStorage`) and **automatically synced** to the backend once connectivity is restored.

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **State Management & Storage:** LocalStorage/MongoDb and  API
- **Offline Detection:** Navigator API (`navigator.onLine`), Service Workers

##  Key Features

<!-- image will be added later -->

-  **Offline-first tracking**: Activities are logged even when disconnected.
-  **Automatic syncing**: Local logs sync with the backend when online.
-  **Analytics portal**: View user journey timelines and behavioral stats.
-  **Seamless UX**: No disruption to users during connectivity loss.

##  Key Flow Diagram

##  Example Use Cases
A user clicks through a multi-step form while offline â€” all steps are stored.

After internet is restored, the steps are automatically synced to the server.

Admins or analysts can view user flows, even if they occurred offline.


## Challenges & Hurdles

 Implementing offline-first analytics is non-trivial due to:

 Lack of standard patterns for local-first analytics workflows.

 Manual implementation of data syncing logic.

 Handling local storage limitations and security concerns.

 Ensuring data integrity and preventing duplication upon sync.

 Most tracking platforms are online-only (e.g., Google Analytics), so this required custom tooling from scratch.


## Future Improvements
Add Service Workers for even more robust offline support.

Support for custom event tagging by developers.

Integrate visual heatmaps and session replays.

Add end-to-end encryption for user data.
